# CodeBot - Mechanism to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) on ANY repository to facilitate code autocomplete/in-filling, repository based chat Q/A, and code generation for an un-seen repository.

## Done 
- The dataset creation pipeline is established, with the ability to upload datasets to HF
- Model selection and fine-tuning completed
- Pulling the model from HF and using HF's PEFTModel for inference

## To-Do
- Implement deduplication and context-preserving file chunking 
- ~~Implement FIM in the model's capabilities~~
