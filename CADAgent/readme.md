Project Objectives
- Assist with CAD design using generative AI.
- Enable natural language input to generate parametric 3D models.
- Jumpstart 3D printing workflows through template generation.
- Address the challenge of getting started with mechanical prototyping.

Approach
- The user provides a natural language prompt describing a mechanical part or modification.
- A language model translates the prompt into Python code.
- The notebook displays the generated code using CadQuery.
- The code is executed, and the 3D model is rendered interactively.

Key Features
- Prompt-to-Model Generation: Convert user prompts into CadQuery-based Python code for 3D model creation.
- Code Display and Execution: View and run the generated CadQuery code in a Jupyter or Kaggle notebook.
- Interactive Model Rendering: Use jupyter-cadquery to render the output as an interactable 3D model.
- Parametric Design Templates: Generate modular and reusable designs tailored to mechanical parts.
