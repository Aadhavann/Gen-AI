Project Objectives
- Accepts a natural language coding prompt
- Uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to apply relevant PEP8 guidelines
- Generates clean Python code using Google Gemini
- Executes the code, and if it fails, automatically attempts to fix it

Key Features
- Prompt-to-Code Generation: Convert user prompts into Python or SQL code using generative AI.
- Code Explanation: Translate complex code into natural language for better understanding.
- PEP 8 coding guidelines: To help maintain consistency, readability, and best practices in Python programming
- Code Output Viewer: View and run the generated code and results directly.

âœ¨ GenAI Capabilities Used
- Embeddings + Vector Search for retrieving coding best practices.
- RAG to enrich prompts with relevant context.
- Code Generation & Execution using GenAI.
- Structured prompting to follow formatting rules.
- Autonomous fixing using contextual prompting based on execution errors.
